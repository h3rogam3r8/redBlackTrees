# Data Structure Validator
This is a Data Structure Validator that will is currently in development. Binary Search Trees have already been completed, as the current iteration of code rotates the BST to ensure AVL specifications, and automatically colors nodes based on Red-Black Tree specifications. Both Min and Max Heaps are currently in development, with future Data Structure validators hopefully including some sort of List ADT's.
